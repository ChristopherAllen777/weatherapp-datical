# Angular Challenge

Create a “Weather Battle” application. Users choose two cities and the application analyzes their upcoming forecast and chooses a winner based on who has the best weather.

Application must be written with current Angular libraries
Material is optional but recommended
Weather data can be obtained from: https://www.apixu.com
Initial page load should prompt the user to search for and choose two locations
The application reads the data and compares the two locations to see which one wins
Check temperature: Can’t be too hot or too cold
Check precipitation: nobody likes rain
Choose at least one other metric to compare on
Application displays winner and loser
Design should bring pride to the winner and shame to the loser
Make sure to include a few tests

- Was able to connect to API. Had some trouble with the logic to compare the two cities. If I had some more time I would impliment it.
- I used Angular Material.
- Some Bootstrap
- Fetch was the method for the GET Requests to the Weather API
- Had a lot of fun figuring this out :) 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
